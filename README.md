# Shopping List
A shared shopping list to avoid miscommunication and keep track of the products we need to buy, this way everyone knows what we need at any time.

## Context
This app was created to solve an existing problem in my home. So, before this app, we had a paper in our house where we would write the things to buy at the supermarket. But the problem was that most of the time we would forget the paper at home, or we wanted to add something and we were not home. To solve all those problems, my parents asked me to create an app that would be our shopping list and it was shared by all of us in real time.

## Requirements
- Shared list (each member would have an account);
- To have a catalog to store the products;
- Ability to add, remove, or update items on the list;
- To have a list of favorite products that could be easily added (for example, products that we need to buy weekly);
- Ability to create multiple lists;
- Ability to filter products when searching.

## Development
Technologies:
- Frameworks: VueJS and Quasar
- State Management: Pinia
- Database: Google Firebase (Authentication and Realtime Database)

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```


### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```
